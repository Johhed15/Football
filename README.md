# Football Viz and Modelling (UNDER WORK)

Welcome to Football Viz and Modelling! This repository contains functions for visualizing football data and creating scatter plots.

## Function Overview

### Scatter Plot Function

I've developed a versatile function that generates scatter plots using football data. Simply select the league, variables for the axes, and the season to get started!

### How to Use
1. Choose the league of interest.
2. Select the variables for the X and Y axes.
3. Specify the season.

Voila! You'll have a plot ready to analyze. üçæ

## Example: Ligue 1 22/23
Here's an example from Ligue 1's 2022/2023 season, featuring the variables xG (Expected Goals) and xAG (Expected Assists Goals). 

- The red dots indicate extreme outliers in the data.
- You can easily customize outlier calculations in the code.

## Visualization

*Note*: README files on GitHub can't display interactive HTML content, so the Plotly image has been saved as a PNG. If you'd like to interact with the plot and explore its functionalities, you can download the HTML file from the link below:
