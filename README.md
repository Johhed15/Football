# Football Viz and Modelling

Welcome to Football Viz and Modelling! This repository contains functions for visualizing football data and creating scatter plots.

## Function Overview

I've developed a versatile function that takes football data with specific columns like player_id, name, team_id, etc., and generates a scatter plot. All you need to do is choose the league you want to analyze, select the variables for the axes, and specify the season. Voila! You've got yourself a plot üçæ

## Example: Ligue 1 2022/2023 Season

Here's an example using data from Ligue 1's 2022/2023 season with the variables xG (Expected Goals) and xAG (Expected Assists). The red dots on the plot represent extreme outliers in the data. You can easily customize how these outliers are calculated within the code.

## Visualization

*Note*: README files on GitHub can't display interactive HTML content, so the Plotly image has been saved as a PNG. If you'd like to interact with the plot and explore its functionalities, you can download the HTML file from the link below:
