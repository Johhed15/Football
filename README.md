# Football Viz and Modelling (UNDER WORK)

Welcome to Football Viz and Modelling! This repository contains functions for visualizing football data and creating scatter plots.

# Function Overview

## scatter_viz_players

I've developed a versatile function that generates scatter plots using football data. Simply select the league, variables for the axes, and the season to get started!


### How to Use
1. **Get Your Football Data**: Obtain your football data with the required variables.
2. **Choose the League**: Select the league of interest.
3. **Select Axes Variables**: Choose the variables for the X and Y axes.
4. **Specify the Season**: Define the season you want to analyze.
5. *(Optional)* **Customize Outliers**: Adjust the multiplier value for standard deviation to identify outliers.
   

### Example: Ligue 1 22/23
Here's an example from Ligue 1's 2022/2023 season, featuring the variables xG (Expected Goals) and xAG (Expected Assists Goals). 

- The red dots indicate outliers in the data.
